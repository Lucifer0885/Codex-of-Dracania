Summary (plain English)
- This project is NOT open source.
- You may use, run, and incorporate compiled/binary forms of this project in your personal, internal, or commercial projects.
- You may NOT redistribute the project's source code, fork the source, or publish modified source code unless you have explicit, written permission from the Copyright Holder (see "Permissions" below).
- Contributions are welcome only by invitation/acceptance from the Copyright Holder. Submitting code or pull requests is a request to contribute and does not grant any rights unless the Copyright Holder accepts your request and (if required) you sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
- This license is MIT-like in its simplicity and disclaimer of warranty, but it deliberately restricts source redistribution and requires contributor acceptance.

Full license text

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity (the "Licensee") to use, copy, execute, and distribute compiled or object (binary) forms of the Software, subject to the following conditions:

1. Source code access and redistribution
   - The Licensee may NOT access, publish, copy, redistribute, sublicense, or otherwise disseminate the Software's source code unless explicit prior written permission is given by the Copyright Holder.
   - Any distribution of the Software in source form, or distribution of derivative works in source form, is prohibited unless the Copyright Holder has provided explicit written authorization.

2. Modifications and derivative works
   - The Licensee may modify the Software for internal use.
   - Distribution of modified code (in source or object form) requires explicit prior written permission from the Copyright Holder. Permission for distribution may be withheld at the Copyright Holder's sole discretion.

3. Contributions
   - Submitting a patch, pull request, issue with code, or other contribution is considered a "Request to Contribute" and does not by itself transfer any rights or grant permission to use contributed content beyond the project repository under the Copyright Holder's control.
   - Contributions will only be accepted and merged after the Copyright Holder has:
     a) explicitly accepted the contributor in writing (which may be via GitHub comment or email), and
     b) received a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) from the contributor when the Copyright Holder requires one.
   - The Copyright Holder may require either a copyright assignment or a license from contributors; the terms will be established per-contributor at the time of acceptance.

4. Patent rights
   - No patent license is granted by this License except as may be explicitly granted in writing by the Copyright Holder for a specific contribution or distribution.

5. Attribution
   - Redistributions of the Software in binary/compiled form must reproduce the copyright notice and this license text in any accompanying documentation.

   - IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

7. Governing law
   - This License is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the Copyright Holder, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

Notes
- This is a custom, source-available, proprietary-style license inspired by permissive licenses like MIT but intentionally NOT open-source. It restricts source redistribution and requires owner acceptance for contributions.
