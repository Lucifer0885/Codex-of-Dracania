# Contributing to this repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This project is source-available but not open-source: contributions are accepted only after explicit acceptance by the repository owner (Lucifer0885). The process below explains how to request contributor status and submit contributions.

1) Request to contribute
- Contact me on discord - lucifer0885.:
  - who you are,
  - what you intend to contribute (feature, bugfix, docs),
  - links to prior relevant work or GitHub profile.

2) Acceptance
- The repository owner will review your request. If accepted, the owner will:
  - leave an explicit acceptance message (GitHub comment or email), and
  - specify whether a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) must be signed.
- Acceptance is at the sole discretion of the repository owner.

3) Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
- If asked to sign a CLA, complete and return the signed CLA before making contributions. A template is included in CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md.
- No contributions will be merged before the CLA is signed when required.

4) Submitting work (after acceptance)
- Forking or publishing the source prior to acceptance is prohibited.
- After acceptance, the owner will provide instructions â€” typically:
  - Fork the repository (if permitted),
  - Create a branch for your work,
  - Submit a pull request referencing the acceptance message.
- The owner may request changes. Merging is performed only by the owner or a person explicitly authorized by the owner.

5) Intellectual property assurances
- By contributing you warrant that you have the right to submit the contribution and that it does not infringe third-party rights.
- Specific IP or copyright transfer conditions will be provided at acceptance.

6) Miscellaneous
- The owner may revoke contributor privileges at any time.
- This repository's license (LICENSE.md) applies to accepted and merged contributions as described in the license and CLA.

If you have questions about this process, open an issue or contact the repository owner.
